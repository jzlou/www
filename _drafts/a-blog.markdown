Yep, I've done it, a personal website. A blog, even. For someone with a purposefully stealthy internet presence, this felt like a fitting move: a simple, designed place where I might share my own content in a way that I control.

It is not a new idea for me: it's one that I've toyed with years. Mostly to satisfy my curiosity of the inner workings of the internet, perhaps echos of a past playing with HTTP and Dreamweaver on my mom's computer. I guess I've never really had the boldness to publish something that's me, in my own words, to no matter how small of an audience.

I'd originally hoped that this first post would establish a purpose for the entire thing, and, thinking about it, I realized that I can't. I don't know what this will yield. But one factor is legacy. I write to capture the shape of my mind, to see reflecting at me the folds, valleys, and ridges that make up me. We are such mysteries, but the 26 letters and various punctuation we use to convey thoughts are so concrete, so real, that it's hard to deny that within a mind, they exist. I exist.

So, I don't know what it's going to look like, but I hope you enjoyed your time here. I don't know how it's going to turn out, perhaps fizzle out like many of my other hobbies and brief passions. Maybe it will be fun to look back and wonder, what was I thinking? At least I'll know I was apprehensive.
